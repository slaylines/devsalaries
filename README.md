How much developers earn? D3.js visualization of dev salaries across the globe based on [Ask HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15088840).

## Why?

[Ask HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15088840) by @ciaoben collected an amazing dataset
with dev salaries in Europe. However the result table is sparse, unstructured and hard to analyze. At
[slaylines](https://slaylines.io) we love to make visualizations which give insight into data.
This salary dataset is no exception. And why on Earth we need to limit it to Europe only?

## Data

We got original data from HN and cleaned it up by removing spam and sparse rows.
We also restricted possible table values. See clean
[CSV dataset](https://github.com/tehcookies/devsalaries/blob/master/data/raw-entries.csv).
