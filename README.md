How much developers earn? A better form and visualizations for [Ask HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15088840).

## Why?
In the original post it is hard to read data and make any conclusions from it because it is sparse and unstructured table with 500+ rows. Since we love visualizations, we decided to give more insight into this amazing salary dataset. We don't limit it to Europe though and we hope to collect data for other regions too.

## Contributions

The initial goal was to provide a visual representation of the dataset. Have your own visualization in mind? Want to improve the existing ones? PRs are more than welcome!
